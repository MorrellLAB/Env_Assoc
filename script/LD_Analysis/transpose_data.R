#   This script is a small function that transposes dataframes
#   and outputs a new transposed file

#   To run the script: ./transpose_data.R [data.txt] [out directory]


#   Read in data and create data frame from it
#   Transpose data
#   Read in file without row.names = 1 to prevent manually shifting first row of cells over one cell
