#   Required arguments:

#   Usage:
#       ./LD_decay_plot.R [prefix] [r2_matrix_dir] [phys_pos_dir] [window_size] [output_directory]
#   Where:
#       1) [prefix] is the prefix of our existing HM_r2.txt file (including underscores or hyphens)
#           i.e. filename Chr1-7_SCRI_RS_152696_HM_r2.txt would have prefix Chr1-7_ and SNP name SCRI_RS_152696
#       2) [r2_matrix_dir] is the full filepath to the directory containing r2 matrix output files from LD_Analysis.sh
#       3) [phys_pos_dir] is the full filepath to the directory containing snp_bac.txt files from LD_Analysis.sh
#       4) [window_size] is the total size of our window (i.e. input 100000 for 50Kb upstream and 50Kb downstream)
#       5) [output_directory] is the full filepath to where we want our plots to go
#           NOTE: filepath to directory should not have last "/" as this will mess up building the filepath
