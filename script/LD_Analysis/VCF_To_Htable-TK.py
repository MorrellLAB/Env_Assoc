#   A python program to read in a VCF file and output a Hudson table-like written by Tom Kono.
#   This version runs in Python 2 and includes minor edits by Chaochih Liu for the inversions project.
#       Note: this is not a "true" Hudson table, since hets are not handled properly.
#       And ancestral state is not printed into the table.

#   Usage:
#       VCF_To_Htable.py [VCF file] [MAF] > [Htable.txt]
